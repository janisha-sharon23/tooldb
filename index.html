                        <p>Rednote has newly added a feature called Inventory management into existing software. Now
                            user can track their stocks in Rednote inventory management software. If product is opted
                            for Track Inventory, Stock will automatically get deducted from stock and stock will be
                            added when user enters purchase invoice under purchase category. Standard inventory
                            management software should have options to enter opening stock to enter the available
                            opening stocks. In case any theft or damage, product count should be adjusted by stock
                            adjustment screen.</p>
